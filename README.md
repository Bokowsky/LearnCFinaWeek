# v2-content
This gitHub repo is the content for all the chapters for learn CF in a Week. This content is written in the markdown language. To understand the syntax for markdown one place to go is https://www.markdownguide.org/.
If you see any sort of corrections that you would like to update, you can do one of two things. One, gitHub gives you the ability to edit the fie in the browser, and commit the change as a pull request for review by the content editors. Two, if you would like to do a git checkout of the content to your local machine, you can also do this. This will allow you to make any changes you see locally, and then commit them back into gitHub for review by the content editors. One tool to use to edit the markdown would be Visual Studio Code because it has a built in markdown previewer.
