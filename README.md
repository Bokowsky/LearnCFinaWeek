# LearnCFinaWeek
This GitHub repo is the content for all the chapters to learn CF in a Week. This content is written in the markdown language and is based on the popular ColdFusion learning resource of the same name.

## day[_n_]
In the day[_n_] directories you'll find the tutorial contents for each day _n_, always consisting of one or more topic files and one or more "Hands-On" files. The topic files are meant to introduce you to core ColdFusion concepts, while the Hands-Ons will get you to try the concepts out on your local ColdFusion Server.

Since we are in the process of improving and restructuring the original resources, there may be only a subset of the days available right now. The rest will get added in time.

## sample-files
This directory contains all sample files that are needed for the Hands-Ons. In [chapter1 - Installing Sample Files](day1/chapter1/01.3_Installing_Sample_Files.md) you will be guided through the installation process.
