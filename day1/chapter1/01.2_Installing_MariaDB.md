# Installing MariaDB

ColdFusion has the ability to communicate with a number of different databases;
for the sample application we will be working on throughout the course, we will be
using MariaDB. If you already have MariaDB installed, you can proceed to the
'Install Sample Files' section. If not, please install MariaDB

Go to <https://mariadb.com/downloads/> and download the latest version for your
operating system.

Follow the on-screen instructions when installing, while leaving any settings
(especially ports - use 3306) at their default value.
