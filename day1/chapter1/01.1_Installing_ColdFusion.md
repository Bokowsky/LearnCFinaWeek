# 1.1 Installing ColdFusion

To be able to program in ColdFusion, a ColdFusion server needs to be installed.

Go to <https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/download-trial/try.html> and download the appropriate version for your system (Win/Mac).

> Unfortunately it's not possible to download the versions that are actually used on our servers anymore (CF11 and CF2018), only the current version is available which is 2021. You also have to input some information about the company before it lets you download. You can enter any information though, it doesn't need to be correct as long as the required fields are filled.

1. Once the file is downloaded, start installation
1. Leave everything on default _except_ the following:
   1. Install Type - select "Developer Edition"
   1. Development Type - select "Development"
   1. ColdFusion Server Profile - select "Development Profile"
   1. Directory for installation - choose one that you like
1. Set passwords when you're asked. Since this is only a developer installation, you can use an    easy-to-remember password and the same password for everything
1. After the installation finishes, open <http://127.0.0.1:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm> in your    web browser, and the ColdFusion Administrator Interface (CF Admin) should appear. If you're prompted    to do an import of previous settings, click "Skip"
